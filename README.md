# **Phantom Plating**
**Gives Phantoms a reason to exist.**



## Phantom Plate Crafting
Place 2 Phantom Membranes in a crafting tables to get a Phantom Plate

## Armor and Tools
Use Phantom Plates to craft Phantom Armor and Phantom Tools, same protection/attack/speed as iron, but with sligthly greated durability

### Repairing Armor and Tools:
Throw Phantom Tools/Armor onto a fire burning over netherrack, the tools and armors are non-flammable, and would heal overtime when are thrown on fire burning on netherrack.

## Enchants
Adds 2 Enchants to the game:
- Phantom Escape (2 Levels)
- Phantom Rider (1 Level)

### Phantom Escape (Enchant):
Only applicatble on Phantom Chestplate.
When the wearer is attacked, grants the wearer Invisibility (5 seconds for Level 1, 9 seconds for Level 2) and applies knockback to attacker (knockback depends on the enchant level)

### Phantom Rider (Enchant):
Only applicable on Phantom Leggings.
When wearing, right clicking phantoms will mount you on them, so you can ride them.

If someone blows a Goat Horn and a player within 50 Block radius is riding a phantom, they will be dismounted.

## Phantom Changes:
Phantoms are now leashable, though they tend to break out at times.
Phantoms can't be controlled with WASD when riding, they move in the direction you are facing.
Phantoms appear red in the nether, looking at them in the nether grants a newly added achievement [All Red]

## Obtaining the Enchantments:
Curing a Zombie Villager has a 50% chance to give it an additional trade of either Phantom Rider, or Phantom Escape Level 1 or 2.
If a villager has already been cured, curing it again will not give it a Phantom Book trade.
